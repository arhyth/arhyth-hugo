Slow thinker. 

So as a disclaimer to the writing I might publish in this blog -- I do not think to write, I write to think.

Writing is [good for you](http://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write). 

Some favorite quotes by other ~~famous~~ people.

> There are only three optimizations: Do less. Do less often. Do faster. Largest gains come from 1, but we spend all our time on 3.


> It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
