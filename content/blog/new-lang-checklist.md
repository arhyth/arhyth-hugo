## So You're Learning a New Language

[ ] Primitive types
[ ] Error Handling
[ ] Dependency management
[ ] Async and/or Concurrency
[ ] Abstraction
[ ] Tooling
[ ] Testing

Great! You want to learn a new language. You're bored at work and you realize you're current workhorse is limiting, or the stack at your new gig uses this weird esoteric stuff with too many parentheses and you hope you could understand even just some part of it. Either way, you want to learn one as efficiently as possible coz you've got other stuff to do. Who learns them for fun anyway? You a nerd? :p

Read the defacto "bible" of the language. A good thumbrule for page count should be around 300-500 pages. Anything more is just too much detail that can be easily googled anyway. Start with the table of contents. DO NOT skip it. A good book's table of contents gives readers an idea what the whole book is about. For programming language textbooks, the table of contents summarizes the language API. That's a major productivity win. You get the gist of your new language powers in less than 10 pages.

The checklist above is one I am using in learning Go. It's even shorter than a table of contents. Just learn enough about each item to distinguish differences in semantics (if any) between the language you're learning and any you already know. Do now worry about syntax. It will come with use. Once you have a basic understanding of the similarities/difference, move on to a different item. Try it and let me know if it works for you.
